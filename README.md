# Overview

Demonstrate the use of data analysis library in Python such as pandas, numpy, and altair to analyze a set of data to clean, organize, and present the data into a useful informations.

The dataset that I am analyzing are informations about cereals from each brands that includes everything about the cereals main ingredients but I will mainly focus on the sugars content and calories. I got my dataset from a github repository that include many other dataset that we can you to analyze data. [Dataset Link](https://github.com/reisanar/datasets)

The purpose for writing this software is to analyze the information on cereals from different brands to see their calories and sugars content, to tell which brand has the lowest calories and the lowest sugars content.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

* What is the sugar content by manufacture?
From the box plot, we can see that the brand Nabisco has second to the lowest sugar minimum at 0 and the sugar maximum is at 6, while the lowest minimum is -1 from the brand Quaker Oats and their sugar maximum is 12.

* What is the relationship between sugar and calories?
From the scatter plot, we can see that as the level of the sugar increase, the calories also increase. More sugars equal more calories.

* How many cereals do each manufactures have in this dataset
From the table, we can see that the brand Kellogs has the most product in this dataset at 23 while American Home Food Products only have 1 of their product in this dataset.
